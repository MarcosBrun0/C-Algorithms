This "Read.Me" file accompanies the programs for Chapter 8, "Data Structures: A Pseudocode Approach Using C" Second Edition-------------------------------------------------------As seen in previous chapters, we have created a special header file, P8AVLADT.h, for the ADT.Also included is a text file for the Gettysburg Address, gtsybrg.txt. This file is used to test Program P8-19.c.While we have executed every instruction in the ADT, it has not been through the extensive testing thata commerical software package undergoes. Therefore, itis entirely possible that there are combinations of events that could raise an error.Because the chapter does not contain the complete set of ADTfunctions, you will not be able to compile and run it untilyou write the missing functions. -------------------------------------------------------Programs:P8-01.h		AVL Tree DeclarationsP8-02.h		Create AVL Tree Application InterfaceP8-03.h		Insert AVL Tree Application InterfaceP8-04.h		Internal Insert FunctionP8-05.h		Internal Insert Left Balance FunctionP8-06.h		Internal Insert Rotate Left and Right FunctionP8-07.h		Delete AVL Tree Application InterfaceP8-08.h		Internal Delete FunctionP8-09.h		Internal Delete Right Balance FunctionP8-10.h		Retrieve AVL Tree Application InterfaceP8-11.h		Internal Retrieve FunctionP8-12.h		Traverse AVL Tree Application InterfaceP8-13.h		Internal Traverse Function P8-14.h		Empty AVL Tree Application InterfaceP8-15.h		Empty AVL Tree Application InterfaceP8-16.h		AVL Tree Count Application InterfaceP8-17.h		AVL Tree Count Application InterfaceP8-18.h		Internal Destroy FunctionP8-19.c		Count Words P8-20.h		Build ListP8-21.h		Get WordP8-22.h		Compare Words FunctionP8-23.h		Print Words ListHeader File:P8AVLADT.h	AVL Tree ADTAdditional Functions:			rightBalance			dltLeftBal			AVL_Print 			_printG & F August 2004

# Introduction
This repository aims to provide implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C.


# Data Structures
## Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure that store elements in contiguous memory locations. They are indexed by integers and provide fast access to elements.

## Linked Lists
Linked Lists are a collection of nodes, where each node contains a data part and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. There are several types of linked lists:

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Linked List
## Stacks
Stacks are a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added and removed only from one end, called the top.

## Queues
Queues are a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

## Trees
Trees are a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root. Each node has zero or more child nodes. Common types of trees include:

Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees
AVL Trees
Red-Black Trees
## Graphs
Graphs consist of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices. Graphs can be:

Directed Graphs
Undirected Graphs

# Algorithms
## Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a particular order (ascending or descending). Common sorting algorithms include:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
